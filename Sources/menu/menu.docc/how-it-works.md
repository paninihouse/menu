# How it works

How *menu* works and how it differs from most Mac programs.

*menu* design is heavily inspired by the suite of [*suckless* tools](https://suckless.org/) for Linux.
These tools are vastly different from what you typically use on the Mac.
They do not have configuration files, extraneous features, or a plugin/extension system.
Instead, they are focused on simplicity, frugality, and a DIY approach.

We deliberately designed *menu* to be extremely limited, specific, and easy to understand, like a *suckless* tool.
This is not software you install, run, and forget about.
You're supposed to fully understand how it works, make it yours, and ultimately give back the enhancements you made to the community.

## How customisation works

*menu* does not read a configuration file somewhere on your system.
Instead, configuration happens directly in the source code by editing ``Config`` and rebuilding the software.
This approach allows us to keep the software extremely minimal and reliable, since all the possible errors are caught at build time.

## No pre-built binaries

Since the configuration requires you to modify the source code, it doesn't make sense to ship pre-built binaries of *menu*.
Therefore, you won't find it in Homebrew or in any other package manager.
The way to install *menu* is simply to download or clone the repository on your system and run `make install`.

## How to extend the functionality

*menu* already works very well out of the box, but what if you need a specific feature that is not available?
Well, you can build it or patch it yourself.

*menu* aims to stay focused and minimal, so it can be read through and understood in roughly an hour.
You're more than encouraged to apply <doc:patches> to extend the software, write your own features, and ultimately publish them for the entire community.

This approach is far more powerful than a plugin/extension ecosystem because you're not limited to what we, as the main developers, decide you can customise or change.
You own the source code, therefore you are free to do whatever you want.
